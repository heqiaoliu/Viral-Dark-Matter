%TONNDATA Convert data to standard neural network cell array form.
%
%  <a href="matlab:doc tonndata">tonndata</a> and <a href="matlab:doc fromnndata">fromnndata</a> convert data from and to standard neural
%  network form.
%
%  Standard neural network cell array data consists of a cell array which
%  has as many rows as there are signals and as many columns as there are
%  timesteps. Each i,jth element of the cell array is a matrix which has
%  as many rows as the ith signal has elements and as many columns as
%  there are samples.
%
%  [Y,wasMatrix] = <a href="matlab:doc tonndata">tonndata</a>(x,columnSamples,cellTime) takes matrix or cell
%  array data X and converts it to standard neural network cell data Y. 
%  
%  If columnSamples is false, then matrix X or matrices in cell array X
%  will be transposed, so row samples will now be stored as column vectors.
%
%  If cellTime is false, then matrix samples will be separated into columns
%  of a cell array so time originally represented as vectors in a matrix
%  will now be represented as columns of a cell array.
%
%  The returned value wasMatrix can be used by FROMNNDATA to reverse the
%  transformation.
%
%  Here data consisting of six timesteps of 5-element vectors is originally
%  represented as a matrix with six columns is converted to standard
%  neural network representation and back.
%
%    x = rand(5,6)
%    [y,wasMatrix] = <a href="matlab:doc tonndata">tonndata</a>(x,true,false)
%    x2 = <a href="matlab:doc fromnndata">fromnndata</a>(y,wasMatrix,columnSamples,cellTime)
%
%  Here data is defined in standard neural network data cell form.
%  Converting this data does not change it.  The data consists of three
%  time series samples of 2-element signals over 3 timesteps.
