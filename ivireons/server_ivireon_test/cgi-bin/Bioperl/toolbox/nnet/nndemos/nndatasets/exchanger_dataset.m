%EXCHANGER_DATASET Heat exchanger dataset
%
% Input-output time series problems consist of predicting the next value
% of one time-series given another time-series. Past values of both series
% (for best accuracy), or only one of the series (for a simpler system)
% may be used to predict the target series.
%
% This dataset can be used to train a neural network to predict the outlet
% liquid temerature of a liquid-saturated steam heat exchanger, from past
% outlet liquid temperatures and/or the liquid flow rate.
%
% LOAD <a href="matlab:doc exchanger_dataset">exchanger_dataset</a>.MAT loads these two variables:
%
%   exchangerInputs - a 1x4000 cell array of scalar values representing
%   4000 time steps of liquid flow rates.
%
%   exchangerTargets - a 1x4000 cell array of scalar values representing
%   4000 timesteps of outlet liquid temperatures.
%
% The sample time for this data was one second.
%
% Water is heated by pressurized saturated steam through a copper tube.
% In this experiment the steam temperature and the inlet liquid temperature,
% which would also have an effect, were kept constant.
%
% The heat exchanger process is a significant benchmark for nonlinear
% control design purposes, since it is characterized by a non minimum
% phase behaviour.  In the references cited below the control problem of
% regulating the output temperature of the liquid-satured steam heat
% exchanger by acting on the liquid flow rate is addressed, and both
% direct and inverse identifications of the data are performed.
