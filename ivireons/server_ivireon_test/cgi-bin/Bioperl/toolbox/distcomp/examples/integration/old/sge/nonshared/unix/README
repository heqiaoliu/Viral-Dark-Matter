UNIX client submitting jobs to a UNIX cluster
=============================================

Information about a MATLAB job is copied to a host on the cluster. The 
SGE qsub command is then called to submit the job to the SGE scheduler.
When the job finishes, its output is copied back to the client host.

Follow these steps to implement the solution:


On the Cluster Hosts
--------------------
1. The decode function must be on the MATLAB path of the workers. 
Typically, this is accomplished by copying sgeNonSharedSimpleDecodeFcn.m 
to $MATLABROOT/toolbox/local on the workers.

2. Refer to $MATLABROOT/toolbox/distcomp/examples/integration/sge/nonshared/unix/matlabpe.template 
for suggestions on how to configure SGE for MATLAB jobs. Make sure to specify <the_number_of_slots> 
and replace <path-to> with $MATLABROOT/toolbox/distcomp/examples/integration/sge/nonshared/unix


On the Client Host
-------------------
1. Set up passwordless ssh and scp from the client host to a host on 
the cluster. The cluster host must be able to call the qsub command to 
submit a job to an SGE scheduler.


2. The files in 
$MATLABROOT/toolbox/distcomp/examples/integration/sge/nonshared/unix 
must be present on the MATLAB path. Copy them to $MATLABROOT/toolbox/local.
Then, start a MATLAB session.


3. Read the documentation for using the Generic Scheduler Interface with 
the Distributed Computing Toolbox.


4. For distributed jobs, you must use sgeNonSharedSimpleSubmitFcn as your submit function. 
This function requires two additional string value inputs:
        a. clusterHost - The name of the cluster host that will call qsub command.
        b. remoteDataLocation - The directory used to store job information on the cluster. 
                                This directory must be accessible by all the worker hosts.

Example:
clusterHost = 'myHost1';
remoteDataLocation = '/share/DATA_LOCATION';
sched = findResource('scheduler', 'type', 'generic');
% Use a local directory as the DataLocation
set(sched, 'DataLocation', '/tmp/DATA_LOCATION');
set(sched, 'ClusterMatlabRoot', '/apps/matlab');
set(sched, 'HasSharedFilesystem', false);
set(sched, 'ClusterOsType', 'unix');
set(sched, 'GetJobStateFcn', @sgeGetJobState);
set(sched, 'DestroyJobFcn', @sgeDestroyJob);
% The SubmitFcn must be a cell array that includes the two additional inputs
set(sched, 'SubmitFcn', {@sgeNonSharedSimpleSubmitFcn, clusterHost, remoteDataLocation});
% If you want to run parallel jobs, you must specify a ParallelSubmitFcn
set(sched, 'ParallelSubmitFcn', {@sgeNonSharedParallelSubmitFcn, clusterHost, remoteDataLocation});

5. Create a job and tasks, submit the job and wait for it to finish before 
getting the results.
