Windows client submitting jobs to a UNIX cluster
================================================

Information about a MATLAB job is copied to a host on the cluster. The
LSF bsub command is then called to submit the job to the LSF scheduler.
When the job finishes, its output is copied back to the client host.

Follow these steps to implement the solution:


On the Cluster Hosts
--------------------
1. The decode function must be on the MATLAB path of the workers.
Typically, this is accomplished by copying lsfNonSharedSimpleDecodeFcn.m,
lsfNonSharedJobArrayDecodeFcn.m and lsfNonSharedParallelDecodeFcn.m to
$MATLABROOT/toolbox/local on the workers.


On the Client Host
-------------------
1. Set up Putty sessions for passwordless access from the client host to
a host on the cluster, using plink and pscp. The cluster host must be able
to call the bsub command to submit a job to an LSF scheduler.

DO NOT use this solution if you do not trust the cluster host.
pscp is used with the -unsafe option. This can be a security risk if the
cluster host is malicious.


2. The files in
$MATLABROOT\toolbox\distcomp\examples\integration\lsf\nonshared\windows
must be present on the MATLAB path. Copy them to $MATLABROOT\toolbox\local.
Then, start a MATLAB session.


3. Read the documentation for using the Generic Scheduler Interface with
the Parallel Computing Toolbox.


4. For distributed jobs, you must use either lsfNonSharedJobArraySubmitFcn
or lsfNonSharedSimpleSubmitFcn as your submit function. For parallel jobs,
you must use lsfNonSharedParallelSubmitFcn. All of these functions require
two additional string value inputs:
        a. clusterHost - The name of the cluster host that will call bsub command.
        b. remoteDataLocation - The directory used to store job information on the cluster.
                                This directory must be accessible by all the worker hosts.

Example:
clusterHost = 'myHost1';
remoteDataLocation = '/share/DATA_LOCATION';
sched = findResource('scheduler', 'type', 'generic');
% Use a local directory as the DataLocation
set(sched, 'DataLocation', 'C:\Temp\DATA_LOCATION');
set(sched, 'ClusterMatlabRoot', '/apps/matlab');
set(sched, 'HasSharedFilesystem', false);
set(sched, 'ClusterOsType', 'unix');
set(sched, 'GetJobStateFcn', @lsfGetJobState);
set(sched, 'DestroyJobFcn', @lsfDestroyJob);
% The SubmitFcn must be a cell array that includes the two additional inputs
set(sched, 'SubmitFcn', {@lsfNonSharedSimpleSubmitFcn, clusterHost, remoteDataLocation});
% If you want to run parallel jobs, you must specify a ParallelSubmitFcn
set(sched, 'ParallelSubmitFcn', {@lsfNonSharedParallelSubmitFcn, clusterHost, remoteDataLocation});


5. Create a job and tasks, submit the job and wait for it to finish before
getting the results. Do the same for parallel jobs if so desired.
