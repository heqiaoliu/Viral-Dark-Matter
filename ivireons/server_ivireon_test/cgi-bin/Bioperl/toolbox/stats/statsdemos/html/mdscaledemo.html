This type of data arises when we have some set of objects, and instead of measuring the characteristics of each object, we can only measure how similar or dissimilar each pair of objects is.  For example, instead of knowing the latitude and longitude of a set of cities, we may only know their inter-city distances.  However, MDS also works with dissimilarities that are more abstract than physical distance.  For example, we may have asked consumers to rate how similar they find several brands of peanut butter.</p><p>The typical goal of MDS is to create a configuration of points in one, two, or three dimensions, whose interpoint distances are "close" to the original dissimilarities.  The different forms of MDS use different criteria to define "close".  These points represent the set of objects, and so a plot of the points can be used as a visual representation of their dissimilarities.</p><p>This demo illustrates the "non-classical" forms of MDS.

%% Non-Classical Multidimensional Scaling
% Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a method for visualizing dissimilarity
% data.  This type of data arises when we have some set of objects, and
% instead of measuring the characteristics of each object, we can only
% measure how similar or dissimilar each pair of objects is.  For example,
% instead of knowing the latitude and longitude of a set of cities, we may
% only know their inter-city distances.  However, MDS also works with
% dissimilarities that are more abstract than physical distance.  For
% example, we may have asked consumers to rate how similar they find
% several brands of peanut butter.
%
% The typical goal of MDS is to create a configuration of points in one,
% two, or three dimensions, whose interpoint distances are "close" to the
% original dissimilarities.  The different forms of MDS use different
% criteria to define "close".  These points represent the set of objects,
% and so a plot of the points can be used as a visual representation of

%% Rothkopf's Morse Code Dataset
% To demonstrate MDS, we'll use data collected in an experiment to
% investigate perception of Morse code (Rothkopf, E.Z., J.Exper.Psych.,
% 53(2):94-101).  Subjects in the study listened to two Morse code signals
% (audible sequences of one or more "dots" and "dashes", representing the
% 36 alphanumeric characters) played in succession, and were asked whether
% the signals were the same or different.  The subjects did not know Morse
% code.  The dissimilarity between two different characters is the
% frequency with which those characters were correctly distinguished.
%
% The 36x36 matrix of dissimilarities is stored as a 630-element vector
% containing the subdiagonal elements of the matrix.  You can use the
% function |squareform|  to transform between the vector format and the
% full matrix form.  Here are the first 5 letters and their
% dissimilarities, reconstructed in matrix form.
