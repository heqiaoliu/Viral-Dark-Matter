Both methods construct new predictor variables, known as components, as linear combinations of the original predictor variables, but they construct those components in different ways.  PCR creates components to explain the observed variability in the predictor variables, without considering the response variable at all.

% possible to interpret intensity peaks in terms of compounds present in
% the gasoline, and then to observe that weights for a particular component
% pick out a small number of those compounds.  From that perspective, fewer
% components are simpler to interpret, and because PLSR often requires
% fewer components to predict the response adequately, it leads to more
% parsimonious models.
% 
% On the other hand, both PLSR and PCR result in one regression coefficient
% for each of the original predictor variables, plus an intercept.  In that
% sense, neither is more parsimonious, because regardless of how many
% components are used, both models depend on all predictors.  More
% concretely, for these data, both models need 401 spectral intensity
% values in order to make a prediction.
%
% However, the ultimate goal may to reduce the original set of variables to
% a smaller subset still able to predict the response accurately.  For
% example, it may be possible to use the PLS weights or the PCA loadings to
% select only those variables that contribute most to each component.  As
% demonstrated earlier, some components from a PCR model fit may serve
% primarily to describe the variation in the predictor variables, and may
% include large weights for variables that are not strongly correlated with
% the response. Thus, PCR can lead to retaining variables that are
% unnecessary for prediction.
%
% For the data used in this demo, the difference in the number of
% components needed by PLSR and PCR for accurate prediction is not great,
% and the PLS weights and PCA loadings seem to pick out the same variables.
% That may not be true for other data.
