% Notice that this is almost the same functional form as the Weibull curve
% used in the curve fitting example above.  However, there is no separate
% parameter to independently scale the vertical height.  Being a PDF, the
% function always integrates to 1.
%
% We'll fit the data with a Weibull distribution, then plot a histogram of the
% data, scaled to integrate to 1, and superimpose the fitted PDF.

% Maximum likelihood can, in a sense, be thought of as finding a Weibull PDF
% to best match the histogram.  But it is not done by minimizing the sum of
% squared differences between the PDF and the bar heights.
%
% As with the curve fitting example above, this model fit should be
% accompanied by estimates of precision and followed by checks on the model's
% goodness of fit; for simplicity we'll leave that out here.


%% Functions for Distribution Fitting
% The Statistics Toolbox includes functions, such as |wblfit|, for fitting
% many different parametric distributions using maximum likelihood, and the
% function |mle| can be used to fit custom distributions for which dedicated
% fitting functions are not explicitly provided.  The function |ksdensity|
% fits a nonparametric distribution model to data.  The Statistics Toolbox
% also provides the GUI |dfittool|, which simplifies many of the tasks in
% distribution fitting, including generation of various visualizations and
% diagnostic plots.  Many types of complicated distributions, including
% distributions with constraints on the parameters, can be fit using functions
% in the Optimization Toolbox. Finally, the |MATLAB| function |fminsearch| can
% be used in many kinds of maximum likelihood distribution fitting.

%%
% Although fitting a curve to a histogram is usually not optimal, there are
% sensible ways to apply special cases of curve fitting in certain
% distribution fitting contexts.  One method, applied on the cumulative
% probability (CDF) scale instead of the PDF scale, is described in the
% <cdffitdemo.html Fitting a Univariate Distribution Using Cumulative
% Probabilities> demo.


%% Summary
% It's not uncommon to do curve fitting with a model that is a scaled
% version of a common probability density function, such as the Weibull,
% Gaussian, gamma, or exponential.  Curve fitting and distribution fitting can
% be easy to confuse in these cases, but the two are very different kinds of
% data analysis.
%
% * *Curve fitting* involves modelling the trend or mean of a response
% variable as a function of a second predictor variable.  The model usually
% must include a parameter to scale the height of the curve, and may also
% include an intercept term.  The appropriate plot for the data is an x-y
% scatterplot.
%
% * *Distribution fitting* involves modelling the probability distribution of
% a single variable.  The model is a normalized probability density function.
% The appropriate plot for the data is a histogram.
