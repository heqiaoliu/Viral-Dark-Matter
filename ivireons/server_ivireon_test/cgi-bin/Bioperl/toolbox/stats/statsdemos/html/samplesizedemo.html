Our data are continuous, and can be modeled with the normal distribution. We need to determine a sample size N so that we can distinguish between a mean of 100 and a mean of 110. We know the standard deviation is 20.</p><p>When we carry out a statistical test, we generally test a <b>null hypothesis</b> against an <b>alternative hypothesis</b>.  We find a test statistic T, and look at its distribution under the null hypothesis.  If we observe an unusual value, say one that has less than 5% chance of happening if the null hypothesis is true, then we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.  (The 5% probability is known as the <b>significance level</b> of the test.)  If the value is not unusual, we do not reject the null hypothesis.</p><p>In this case the test statistic T is the sample mean.  Under the null hypothesis it has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20/sqrt(N). First let's look at a fixed sample size, say N=16.  We will reject the null hypothesis if T is in the shaded region, which is the upper tail of its distribution.  That makes this a one-sided test, since we will not reject if T is in the lower tail.  The cutoff for this shaded region is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.</p><pre class="codeinput">rand(<span class="string">'state'</span>,0); randn(<span class="string">'state'</span>,0);

%% Testing a Normal Mean with Known Standard Deviation, One-Sided
% Just to introduce some concepts, let's consider an unrealistically simple
% example where we want to test a mean and we know the standard deviation.
% Our data are continuous, and can be modeled with the normal distribution.
% We need to determine a sample size N so that we can distinguish between a
% mean of 100 and a mean of 110. We know the standard deviation is 20.
%
% When we carry out a statistical test, we generally test a *null
% hypothesis* against an *alternative hypothesis*.  We find a test
% statistic T, and look at its distribution under the null hypothesis.  If
% we observe an unusual value, say one that has less than 5% chance of
% happening if the null hypothesis is true, then we reject the null
% hypothesis in favor of the alternative.  (The 5% probability is known as
% the *significance level* of the test.)  If the value is not unusual, we do
% not reject the null hypothesis.
%
% In this case the test statistic T is the sample mean.  Under the null
% hypothesis it has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20/sqrt(N).
% First let's look at a fixed sample size, say N=16.  We will reject the

%% Testing a Normal Mean with Unknown Standard Deviation, Two-Sided
% Now let's suppose we don't know the standard deviation, and we want to
% perform a two-sided test, that is, one that rejects the null hypothesis
% whether the sample mean is too high or too low.
%
% The test statistic is a t statistic, which is the difference between the
% sample mean and the mean being tested, divided by the standard error of
% the mean.  Under the null hypothesis, this has Student's t distribution
% with N-1 degrees of freedom.  Under the alternative hypothesis, the
% distribution is a noncentral t distribution with a noncentrality
% parameter equal to the normalized difference between the true mean and
% the mean being tested.
%
% For this two-sided test we have to allocate the 5% chance of an error
% under the null hypothesis equally to both tails, and reject if the test
% statistic is too extreme in either direction.  We also have to consider
% both tails under any alternative.

% Instead of examining the power function just under the null hypothesis
% and a single alternative value of mu, we can look at it as a function of
% mu.  The power increases as mu moves away from the null hypothesis value
% in either direction.  We can use the |sampsizepwr| function to compute
% the power.  For a power calculation we need to specify a value for the
% standard deviation, which we suspect will be roughly 20.  Here's a
% picture of the power function for a sample size N=16.

% 80%.  If we maintain the power at 80%, what alternative could we
% detect?
mu1 = sampsizepwr('t',[100 20],[],.8,50)

%% Testing a Proportion
% Now let's turn to the problem of determining the sample size needed to
% distinguish between two proportions.  Suppose that we are sampling a
% population in which about 30% favor some candidate, and we want to sample
% enough people so we can distinguish this value from 33%.
%
% The idea here is the same as before.  Here we can use the sample count as
% our test statistic.  This count has a binomial distribution.  For any
% sample size N we can compute the cutoff for rejecting the null hypothesis
% P=0.30.  For N=100, for instance, we would reject the null hypothesis if
% the sample count is larger than a cutoff value computed as follows:

N = 100; alpha = 0.05; p0 = 0.30; p1 = 0.33;
cutoff = binoinv(1-alpha, N, p0)

%%
% A complication with the binomial distribution comes because it is
% discrete.  The probability of exceeding the cutoff value is not exactly
% 5%:

1 - binocdf(cutoff, N, p0)

%%
% Once again, let's compute the power against the alternative P=0.33 for a
% range of sample sizes.  We'll use a one-sided (right-tailed) test because
% we're interested only in alternative values greater than 30%.

Nvec = 50:50:2000;

title('Power function for the alternative: p = 0.33')

%%
% We can use the |sampsizepwr| function to request the sample size required
% for a power of 80%.

approxN = sampsizepwr('p',p0,p1,0.80,[],'tail','right')

%%
% A warning message informs us that the answer is just approximate.  If we
% look at the power function for different sample sizes, we can see that
% the function is generally increasing, but irregular because the binomial
% distribution is discrete. Let's look at the probability of rejecting the
% null hypothesis for both p=0.30 and p=0.33 in the range of samples sizes
% from 1470 to 1480.

subplot(3,1,1);
Nvec = 1470:1480;
power = sampsizepwr('p',p0,p1,[],Nvec,'tail','right');
plot(Nvec,power,'ro-',[min(Nvec),max(Nvec)],[DesiredPower DesiredPower],'k:');

cutoff = binoinv(1-alpha, Nvec, p0);

xlabel('N = sample size')
ylabel('Cutoff')

%%
% This plot reveals that the power function curve (top plot) is not only
% irregular, but also decreases at some sample sizes.  These are the
% sample sizes for which it is necessary to increase the cutoff value
% (bottom plot) in order to keep the significance level (middle plot) no
% larger than 5%.  We can find a smaller sample size within this range
% that gives the desired power of 80%:

min(Nvec(power>=0.80))

%% Testing a Correlation
% In the examples we've considered so far, we were able to figure out the
% cutoff for a test statistic to achieve a certain significance level, and
% to calculate the probability of exceeding that cutoff under an
% alternative hypothesis.  For our final example, let's consider a problem
% where that is not so easy.
%
% Imagine we can take samples from two variables X and Y, and we want to
% know what sample size we would need to test whether they are uncorrelated
% versus the alternative that their correlation is as high as 0.4.
% Although it is possible to work out the distribution of the sample
% correlation by transforming it to a t distribution, let's use a method
% that we can use even in problems where we can't work out the distribution
% of the test statistic.
%
% For a given sample size, we can use Monte Carlo simulation to determine
% an approximate cutoff value for a test of the correlation.  Let's do a
% large simulation run so we can get this value accurately.  We'll start
% with a sample size of 25.

nsamples = 10000; N = 25; alpha = 0.05; conf = 1-alpha;
r = zeros(1,nsamples);
for j=1:nsamples
    xy = normrnd(0,1,N,2);
    r(j) = corr(xy(:,1),xy(:,2));
end
cutoff = quantile(r,conf)

%%
% Then we can generate samples under the alternative hypothesis, and
% estimate the power of the test.

nsamples = 1000; mu = [0; 0]; sig = [1 0.4; 0.4 1];
r = zeros(1,nsamples);
for j=1:nsamples
    xy = mvnrnd(mu,sig,N);
    r(j) = corr(xy(:,1),xy(:,2));
end
[power,powerci] = binofit(sum(r>cutoff),nsamples)

%%
% We estimate the power to be 65%, and we have 95% confidence that the true
% value is between 62% and 68%.  To get a power of 80%, we need a larger
% sample size.  We might try increasing N to 50, estimating the cutoff
% value for this sample size, and repeating the power simulation.

nsamples = 10000; N = 50; alpha = 0.05; conf = 1-alpha;
r = zeros(1,nsamples);
for j=1:nsamples
    xy = normrnd(0,1,N,2);
    r(j) = corr(xy(:,1),xy(:,2));
end
cutoff = quantile(r,conf)

nsamples = 1000; mu = [0; 0]; sig = [1 0.4; 0.4 1];
r = zeros(1,nsamples);
for j=1:nsamples
    xy = mvnrnd(mu,sig,N);
    r(j) = corr(xy(:,1),xy(:,2));
end
[power,powerci] = binofit(sum(r>cutoff),nsamples)

%%
% This sample size gives a power better than our target of 80%.  We could
% continue experimenting this way, trying to find a sample size less than
% 50 that would meet our requirements.

%% Conclusion
% The probability functions in the Statistics Toolbox can be used to
% determine the sample size required to achieve a desired level of power in
% a hypothesis test.  In some problems the sample size can be compute
% directly; in others it is necessary to search over a range of sample
% sizes until the right value is found. Random number generators can help
% verify that the desired power is met, and can also be used to study the
% power of a specific test under alternative conditions.
