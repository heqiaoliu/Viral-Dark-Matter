%% FIR Gaussian Pulse-shaping Filter Design
% This demo shows the design of the Gaussian pulse-shaping FIR filter and
% the parameters influencing this design. The FIR Gaussian pulse-shaping
% filter design is done by truncating a sampled version of the
% continuous-time impulse response of the Gaussian filter which is given
% by:
%  
% $$h(t) = \frac{\sqrt \pi} {a} e^{- \frac{\pi^2 t^2}{a^2}}$$
% 
% The parameter 'a' is related to 3-dB bandwidth-symbol time product (B*Ts) 
% of the Gaussian filter as given by:
% 
% $$a = \frac{1}{B T_s} \sqrt{\frac{\log 2}{2}}$$
% 
% There are two approximation errors in the design: a truncation error and
% a sampling error. The truncation error is due to a finite-time (FIR)
% approximation of the theoretically infinite impulse response of the ideal
% Gaussian filter. The sampling error (aliasing) is due to the fact that a
% Gaussian frequency response is not really band-limited in a strict sense
% (i.e. the energy of the Gaussian signal beyond a certain frequency is not
% exactly zero). This can be noted from the transfer function of the
% continuous-time Gaussian filter, which is given as below: 
%   
% $$H(f) = e^{ - a^2 f^2}$$
% 
% As f increases, the frequency response tends to zero, but never is
% exactly zero, which means that it cannot be sampled without some aliasing
% occurring.

%% Continuous-time Gaussian Filter 
% To design a continuous-time Gaussian filter, let us define the symbol
% time (Ts) to be 1 micro-second and the number of symbols between the
% start of the impulse response and its peak (NT) to be 3. From the
% equations above, we can see that the impulse response and the frequency
% response of the Gaussian filter depend on the parameter 'a' which is
% related to the 3 dB bandwidth-symbol time product. To study the effect of
% this parameter on the Gaussian FIR filter design, we will define various
% values of 'a' in terms of Ts and compute the corresponding bandwidths.
% Then, we will plot the impulse response for each 'a' and the magnitude
% response for each bandwidth.

%% FIR approximation of the Gaussian Filter
% We will design the FIR Gaussian filter using the FDESIGN.PULSESHAPING
% function. The FDESIGN.PULSESHAPING function takes the oversampling factor
% (i.e. the number of samples per symbol), the 3-dB bandwidth-symbol time
% product and number of symbol periods between the start of the filter
% impulse response and the end as inputs. 
%
% The oversampling factor (OF) determines the sampling frequency and the
% filter length and hence, plays a significant role in the Gaussian FIR
% filter design. The approximation errors in the design can be reduced with
% an appropriate choice of oversampling factor. We illustrate this by
% comparing the Gaussian FIR filters designed with two different
% oversampling factors.
% 
% First, we will consider oversampling factor of 16 to design the discrete Gaussian
% filter.

% Notice that the first two FIR filters exhibit aliasing error and the last
% two FIR filters exhibit the truncation error. Aliasing occurs when the
% sampling frequency is not greater than the Nyquist frequency. In case of
% the first two filters, the bandwidth is large enough that the
% oversampling factor does not separate the spectral replicas enough to
% avoid aliasing. The amount of aliasing is not very significant however. 
% 
% On the other hand, the last two FIR filters show the FIR approximation
% limitation before any aliasing can occur. The magnitude responses of
% these two filters reach a floor before they can overlap with the spectral
% replicas.

%% Significance of the Oversampling Factor 
% The aliasing and truncation errors vary according to the oversampling
% factor. If the oversampling factor is reduced, these errors will be more
% severe, since this reduces the sampling frequency (thereby moving the
% replicas closer) and also reduces the filter lengths (increasing the
% error in the FIR approximation).
