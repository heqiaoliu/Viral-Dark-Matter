Using the sequency location at a which a peak occurs, the corresponding Walsh-Hadamard code (or the Walsh function) used can be determined.

%% Introduction
% The Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) is a suboptimal, non-sinusoidal, 
% orthogonal transformation that decomposes a signal into a set of
% orthogonal, rectangular waveforms called Walsh functions. The
% transformation has no multipliers and is real because the amplitude of
% Walsh (or Hadamard) functions has only two values, +1 or -1. 

%%
% WHTs are used in many different applications, such as power spectrum
% analysis, filtering, processing speech and medical signals, multiplexing
% and coding in communications, characterizing non-linear signals, solving
% non-linear differential equations, and logical design and analysis.

%%
% This demo provides an overview of the Walsh-Hadamard transform and some
% of its properties by showcasing two applications, communications using
% spread spectrum and processing of ECG signals.
 
%% Walsh (or Hadamard) Functions 
% Walsh functions are rectangular or square waveforms with values of -1 or
% +1. An important characteristic of Walsh functions is sequency which is
% determined from the number of zero-crossings per unit time interval.
% Every Walsh function has a unique sequency value.  

%%
% Walsh functions can be generated in many ways (see [1]). Here we use the
% |hadamard| function in MATLAB(R) to generate Walsh functions. Length
% eight Walsh functions are generated as follows.

N = 8;  % Length of Walsh (Hadamard) functions
hadamardMatrix = hadamard(N) 

%%
% The rows (or columns) of the symmetric |hadamardMatrix| contain the Walsh
% functions.  The Walsh functions in the matrix are not arranged in
% increasing order of their sequencies or number of zero-crossings (i.e.
% 'sequency order') but are arranged in 'Hadamard order'. The Walsh matrix,
% which contains the Walsh functions along the rows or columns in the
% increasing order of their sequencies is obtained by changing the index of
% the |hadamardMatrix| as follows.

HadIdx = 0:N-1;                          % Hadamard index
M = log2(N)+1;                           % Number of bits to represent the index        
%%
% Each column of the sequency index (in binary format) is given by the
% modulo-2 addition of columns of the bit-reversed Hadamard index (in
% binary format). 

binHadIdx = fliplr(dec2bin(HadIdx,M))-'0'; % Bit reversing of the binary index
binSeqIdx = zeros(N,M-1);                  % Pre-allocate memory
for k = M:-1:2
    % Binary sequency index 
    binSeqIdx(:,k) = xor(binHadIdx(:,k),binHadIdx(:,k-1));
end
SeqIdx = binSeqIdx*pow2((M-1:-1:0)');    % Binary to integer sequency index
walshMatrix = hadamardMatrix(SeqIdx+1,:) % 1-based indexing

%% Discrete Walsh-Hadamard Transform
% The forward and inverse Walsh transform pair for a signal x(t) of length N
% are 
%
% $$y_n = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x_i WAL(n,i),      n=1,2,\ldots,N-1$$
%
% $$x_i = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}y_n WAL(n,i),                 i=1,2,\ldots,N-1$$
%    
% Fast algorithms, similar to the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, have been
% developed to implement the Walsh-Hadamard transform with complexity
% O(NlogN) (see [1] and [2]). Since the Walsh matrix is symmetric, both the
% forward and inverse transformations are identical operations except for
% the scaling factor of 1/N. The functions |fwht| and |ifwht| implement the
% forward and the inverse WHT respectively.
 
%%
% *Example 1*  
% Perform WHT on the Walsh matrix. The expected result is an identity
% matrix because the rows (or columns) of the symmetric Walsh matrix
% contain the Walsh functions. 
y1 = fwht(walshMatrix)                % Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform    

%%
% *Example 2* 
% Construct a discontinuous signal by scaling and adding arbitrary columns
% of the Hadamard matrix. This signal is formed using weighted Walsh
% functions, so the WHT should return non-zero values equal to the weights
% at the respective sequency indices. While evaluating the WHT, the
% |ordering| is specified as 'hadamard', because a Hadamard matrix (instead
% of the Walsh matrix) is used to obtain the Walsh functions.
N = 8;
H = hadamard(N);                      % Hadamard matrix
% Construct a signal by adding a few weighted Walsh functions
x = 8.*H(1,:) + 12.*H(3,:) + 18.*H(5,:) + 10.*H(8,:);           
y = fwht(x,N,'hadamard')      

%% 
% WHT is a reversible transform and the original signal can be recovered
% perfectly using the inverse transform. The norm between the original
% signal and the signal obtained from inverse transformation equals zero,
% indicating perfect reconstruction.
xHat = ifwht(y,N,'hadamard');
norm(x-xHat)
%%
% The Walsh-Hadamard transform involves expansion using a set of
% rectangular waveforms, so it is useful in applications involving
% discontinuous signals that can be readily expressed in terms of Walsh
% functions. Below are two applications of Walsh-Hadamard transforms.

%% Walsh-Transform Applications
% *ECG signal processing*
%  Often, it is necessary to record electro-cardiogram (ECG) signals of
%  patients at different instants of time. This results in a large amount

% *Communication using Spread Spectrum*
% Spread spectrum-based communication technologies, like CDMA, use Walsh
% codes (derived from Walsh functions) to spread message signals and WHT
% transforms to despread them. Since Walsh codes are orthogonal, any
% Walsh-encoded signal appears as random noise to a terminal unless that
% terminal uses the same code for encoding. Below we demonstrate the
% process of spreading, determining Walsh codes used for spreading, and
% despreading to recover the message signal.
%%
% Two CDMA terminals spread their respective message signals using two
% different Walsh codes (also known as Hadamard codes) of length 64. The
% spread message signals are corrupted by a additive white Gaussian noise
% of variance 0.1. 
%%
% At the receiver (base station), signal processing is non-coherent and the
% received sequence of length N needs to be correlated with 2^N Walsh
% codewords to extract the Walsh codes used by the respective transmitters.
% This can be effectively done by transforming the received signals to
% sequency domain using the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform. Using the
% sequency location at a which a peak occurs, the corresponding
% Walsh-Hadamard code (or the Walsh function) used can be determined. The
% plot below shows that Walsh-Hadamard codes with sequency (with |ordering|
% = 'hadamard') 60 and 10 were used in the first and the second
% transmitter, respectively.

%%
% Despreading (or decoding) to extract the message signal can be carried
% out in a straightforward manner by multiplying the received signals by
% the respective Walsh-hadamard codes generated using the |hadamard|
% function. (Note that the indexing in MATLAB(R) starts from 1, hence
% Walsh-Hadamard codes with sequency 60 and 10 are obatined from by
% selecting the columns (or rows) 61 and 11 in the Hadamard matrix.)

N = 64; 
hadamardMatrix = hadamard(N);
codeTx1 = hadamardMatrix(:,61);         % Code used by transmitter 1  
codeTx2 = hadamardMatrix(:,11);         % Code used by transmitter 2    
    
%%
% The decoding operation to recover the original message signal is 
xHat1 = codeTx1 .* rcvdSig1;            % Decoded signal at receiver 1
xHat2 = codeTx2 .* rcvdSig2;            % Decoded signal at receiver 2

%% 
% The recovered message signals at the receiver side are shown below and
% superimposed with the original signals for comparison.
