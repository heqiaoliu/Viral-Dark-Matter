MATLAB&reg; Signal Processing Toolbox&#8482; provides the firpm function which designs such filters.

For an odd length filter, the magnitude response of a Hilbert Transformer is zero for w = 0 and w = pi.

%% Introduction
% Single Sideband (SSB) Modulation is an efficient form of Amplitude
% Modulation (AM) that uses half the bandwidth used by AM.  This technique
% is most popular in applications such as telephony, HAM radio, and HF
% communications, i.e., voice-based communications.  This demo shows how to
% implement SSB Modulation using a Hilbert Transformer.
%
% To motivate the need to use a Hilbert Transformer in SSB modulation,
% it's helpful to first quickly review double sideband modulation.
%
%% Double Sideband Modulation
% A simple form of AM is the Double Sideband (DSB) Modulation, which
% typically consists of two frequency-shifted copies of a modulated signal
% on either side of a carrier frequency. More precisely this is referred
% to as a DSB Suppressed Carrier, and is defined as
% 
% $$ f[n] = m[n]\cos( 2 \pi f_o n/f_s) $$
%
% where m[n] is usually referred to as the message signal and fo is the
% carrier frequency.   As shown in the equation above, DSB modulation
% consists of multiplying the message signal m[n] by the carrier
% cos(2*pi*fo*n/fs), therefore, we can use the modulation theorem of
% Fourier transforms to calculate the transform of f[n]
%
% $$ F(f) = \frac{1}{2} [M(f-f_o) + M(f+f_o)] $$
%
% where M(f) is the Discrete-time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of m[n]. If the
% message signal is lowpass with bandwidth W, then F(f) is a bandpass
% signal with twice the bandwidth. Let's look at an example DSB signal and
% its spectrum.

% Define and plot a message signal which contains three tones at 500, 600,
% and 700 Hz with varying amplitudes.
Fs = 10e3;
t = 0:1/Fs:.1-1/Fs;
m = sin(2*pi*500*t) + .5*sin(2*pi*600*t) + 2*sin(2*pi*700*t);;

set(gca,'xlim',Xlims,'ylim',[-20 0])

%%
% Our positive frequency components are now at -6, -18, and -12 dB.
%
% Now that we've defined DSB modulation, let's take a look at single
% sideband modulation.

%% Single Sideband Modulation
% Single Sideband (SSB) Modulation is similar to DSB modulation, but
% instead of using the whole spectrum it uses a filter to select either the
% lower or upper sideband.  The selection of the lower or upper sideband
% results in the lower sideband (LSB) or upper sideband (USB) modulation,
% respectively. There are two approaches to eliminating one of the
% sidebands, one is the filter method and the other is the phasing method.
% The process of selective filtering of the upper or lower sideband is
% difficult due to the stringent filters required, especially if there's
% signal content close to DC. This demo will discuss the alternative, the
% phasing method, which uses a Hilbert Transformer to implement SSB
% Modulation.
%
% SSB modulation requires the shifting of the message signal to another
% center frequency without creating pairs of frequency components X(f-fo)
% and X(f+fo) as in the case of the DSB modulation, i.e., avoiding the need
% to filter either the upper or lower sideband.  This can be done by using
% a Hilbert Transformer.  
%
% Let's first review the definition and properties of the ideal Hilbert
% Transform before we discuss its use in SSB modulation. This will help
% motivate its use in SSB modulation.

%% Ideal Hilbert Transform
% The discrete Hilbert Transform is a process by which a signal's negative
% frequencies are phase-advanced by 90 degrees and the positive frequencies
% are phase-delayed by 90 degrees. Shifting the results of the Hilbert
% Transform (+j) and adding it to the original signal creates a complex
% signal as we'll see below.
%
% If mi[n] is the Hilbert Transform of mr[n], then:
%
% $$m_c[n] = m_r[n] + jm_i[n]$$
%
% is a complex signal known as the Analytic Signal.  The diagram below
% shows the generation of an analytic signal by means of the ideal Hilbert
% Transform.
%
% <<hilbertdiagram.png>>
%
% One important characteristic of the analytic signal is that its spectral
% content lies in the positive Nyquist interval. This is because if we
% shift the imaginary part of our analytic (complex) signal by 90 degrees
% (+j) and add it to the real part, the negative frequencies will cancel
% while the positive frequencies will add. This results in a signal with no
% negative frequencies.  Also, the magnitude of the frequency component in
% the complex signal is twice the magnitude of the frequency component in
% the real signal.  This is similar to a one-sided spectrum, which contains
% the total signal power in the positive frequencies.  
%
% Next we introduce a Spectral Shifter.  The Spectral Shifter shifts
% (translates) the spectral content of a signal by modulating the analytic
% signal formed from the signal whose spectrum we want to shift.  This
% concept can be used for SSB modulation as shown later.

%% Spectral Shifter
% Using the message signal m[n] defined above we'll create an analytic
% signal by employing the Hilbert Transform, which will then be modulated
% to the desired center frequency.  The scheme is shown in the diagram
% below.
%
% <<hilbertspectralshifter.png>>
%
% Using this method of spectral shifting will ensure that the power of our
% signal is shifted to the frequency of interest while maintaining a
% real-valued signal in the end.
%
% As we indicated earlier the analytic signal is made up of the original
% real-valued signal plus the Hilbert Transform of that real signal.
% Running the real signal by the hilbert function in the 
% Signal Processing Toolbox(TM) will produce an analytic signal. 
%
% Note: The hilbert function produces the complete analytic (complex)
% signal, not just the imaginary part.
mc = hilbert(m);

set(gca,'xlim',Xlims,'ylim',[-75 6])

%%
% As shown in the spectrum plot, our analytic signal is complex and only
% contains positive frequency components.  Moreover, if we measure the
% power, or zoom in our plot further at the positive frequency component
% we'll see that the power of the frequency components of the analytic
% signal is twice the total power of the positive (or negative) frequency
% component of the real signal, i.e., it's similar to a one-sided spectrum
% which contains the signal's total power.  See zoomed-in plot below.

set(gca,'xlim',[0.1 1],'ylim',[-10 6])

%%
% We see that the power of the analytic (complex) signal's frequency
% components 500, 600, and 700 Hz are roughly 0, -6, and 6 dB,
% respectively, which is the original signal's total power.  These values
% correspond to our original real-valued signal which has three tones with
% amplitudes of 1, 0.5, and 2, respectively.
%
% At this point we can modulate the analytic signal to shift the spectral
% content to another center frequency without producing frequency component
% pairs and maintain a real-valued signal.  
%
% To modulate the signal to the carrier frequency fo, we'll multiply the
% analytic signal by an exponential.
mcm = mc.*exp(j*2*pi*fo*t);  

%%
% As shown in the Spectral Shifter diagram, after modulating our signal
% we'll compute the real part.  The spectrum of which is
msspectrum(h,real(mcm),opts)

% Zooming in we get
Xlims = get(gca,'xlim');
set(gca,'xlim',Xlims,'ylim',[-75 0])
set(gcf,'color','white');

%%
% As shown in the plot above our signal has been modulated to a new center
% frequency of fo without creating the frequency pairs, i.e., it resulted
% in upper sideband.
%
% If we compare the spectral plot above with that of the DSB modulation we
% can see that the Spectral Shifter accomplished the SSB modulation.

%% Efficient Implementation of SSB Modulation
% From our previous derivation we can see that the SSB modulated signal,
% f[n] can be written as
%
% $$ f[n] = \Re[ m_c[n] \exp(j2 \pi f_o n/f_s) ] $$
%
% where mc[n] is the analytic signal defined as
%
% $$m_c[n] = m[n] + j \tilde{m}[n]$$
%
% Expanding that equation and taking the real part we get
%
% $$ f[n] =  [m[n] \cos( 2 \pi f_o n /f_s) - \tilde{m}[n] \sin( 2 \pi f_o n/f_s)] $$
%
% which results in a single sideband, upper sideband (SSBU).  Similarly, we
% can define the SSB lower sideband (SSBL) by
%
% $$ f[n] = \Re[ m_c[n] \exp(-j2 \pi f_o n/f_s) ] $$
%
% $$ f[n] =  [m[n] \cos( 2 \pi f_o n /f_s) + \tilde{m}[n] \sin( 2 \pi f_o n/f_s)] $$
%
% The SSBU equation above suggests a more efficient way of implementing
% SSB. Rather than performing the complex multiplication of mc[n] with
% exp(j*2*pi*fo*n/fs) and then throwing away the imaginary part, we can
% compute only the quantities we need by implementing SSBU as shown below.

%%
% To implement the SSB modulation shown above we need to calculate the
% Hilbert Transform of our message signal m[n] and modulate both signals.
% But before we do that we need to point out the fact that ideal Hilbert
% transformers are not realizable.  However, algorithms that approximate
% the Hilbert Transformer, such as the Parks-McClellan FIR filter design
% technique, have been developed which can be used.  MATLAB(R) 
% Signal Processing Toolbox(TM) provides the firpm function which designs such
% filters.  Also, since the filter introduces a delay we need to compensate
% for that delay by adding delay (N/2, where N is the filter order) to the
% signal that is being multiplied by the cosine term as shown below.
%
% <<hilbertssbmodulation2.png>>
%
% For the FIR Hilbert transformer we will use an odd length filter which is
% computationally more efficient than an even length filter.  Albeit even
% length filters enjoy smaller passband errors.
% The savings in odd length filters is a result that these filters have
% several of the coefficients that are zero. Also, using an odd length
% filter will require a shift by an integer time delay, as opposed to a
% fractional time delay that is required by an even length filter.  For an
% odd length filter, the magnitude response of a Hilbert Transformer is
% zero for w = 0 and w = pi. For even length filers the magnitude response
% doesn't have to be 0 at pi, therefore they have increased bandwidths.
% So for odd length filters the useful bandwidth is limited to
%
% $$ 0 < w < \pi $$
%
% Let's design the filter and plot its zero-phase response.
d = fdesign.hilbert('N,TW',60,.1);
Hd = design(d,'equiripple');
hfv = fvtool(Hd,'Analysis','Magnitude',...
    'MagnitudeDisplay','Zero-phase',...
    'FrequencyRange','[-pi, pi)');
set(hfv,'Color','white');

%%
% To approximate the Hilbert Transform we'll filter the message signal
% with the filter Hd.

m_tilde = filter(Hd,m);

%% 
% The upper sideband signal is then
G = order(Hd)/2;   % Filter delay
m_delayed = [zeros(1,G),m(1:end-G)];
f = m_delayed.*cos(2*pi*fo*t) - m_tilde.*sin(2*pi*fo*t);

%%
% and the spectrum is
msspectrum(h,f,opts)

% Zooming in we get
Xlims = get(gca,'xlim');
set(gca,'xlim',Xlims,'ylim',[-75 0])
set(gcf,'color','white');

%%
% As seen in the plot above we successfully modulated the message signal
% (three tones) to the carrier frequency of 3.5k Hz and kept only the upper
% sideband.


%% Summary
% As we have seen, by using an approximation to the Hilbert Transform we
% can produce analytic signals, which are useful in many signal
% applications that require spectral shifting.  Specifically we have seen
% how an approximate Hilbert Transformer can be used to implement Single
% Sideband Modulation.
