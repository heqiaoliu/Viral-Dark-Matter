To access the list of supported structures directly, type "help dfilt.structures".  For further information about a particular structure or method, type "help dfilt.&lt;structure&gt;" or "help dfilt/&lt;method&gt;".  For example:</p><pre class="codeinput">help <span class="string">dfilt/freqz</span>
</pre><pre class="codeoutput"> FREQZ  Discrete-time filter frequency response.
    [H,W] = FREQZ(Hd,N) returns the N-point complex frequency response
    vector H and the N-point frequency vector W in radians/sample of the
    discrete-time filter Hd.  The frequency response is evaluated at N
    points equally spaced around the upper half of the unit circle. If N
    isn't specified, it defaults to 8192.
 
    FREQZ(Hd) with no output argument will launch FVTool in the Magnitude
    and Phase Response.
 
    [H,W] = FREQZ(Hd) returns a matrix H if Hd is a vector.  Each column of
    the matrix corresponds to each filter in the vector.  If a row vector
    of frequency points is specified, each row of the matrix corresponds to
    each filter in the vector.

%% Getting Started with Discrete-Time Filter (DFILT) Objects
% DFILT objects allow you to simulate and analyze discrete-time filters in
% a variety of structures including direct forms, second-order sections,
% lattice, and state-space.

%% Getting Help 
% Typing "help dfilt" in the command window gives you a list of structures
% supported by the Signal Processing Toolbox(TM) as well as methods
% operating on dfilt objects.  To access the list of supported structures
% directly, type "help dfilt.structures".  For further information about a
% particular structure or method, type "help dfilt.<structure>" or "help
% dfilt/<method>".  For example:
help dfilt/freqz


%% Constructing a Discrete-Time Filter
% To create a DFILT object, you need to select the structure to be used.
% For example, you can implement a linear-phase even-order FIR filter 
% either as a direct-form FIR or as a symmetric direct-form FIR.

b = fir1(50,.4);        % 50th-order linear-phase FIR filter
h1 = dfilt.dffir(b);    % Direct-form FIR implementation
h2 = dfilt.dfsymfir(b); % Symmetric direct-form FIR implementation

%%
% Note that one usually does not construct DFILT filters explicitly.
% Instead, one obtains these filters as a result from a design using
% FDESIGN. 
f = fdesign.lowpass('N,F3dB',5,.5);
h = design(f,'butter');  % 5th-order IIR filter
%%
% Use the CONVERT method to convert a filter structure to another.
hdf1  = convert(h,'df1');  % Direct-form I implementation
hdf1t = convert(h,'df1t'); % Transposed direct-form I implementation
hdf2  = convert(h,'df2');  % Direct-form II implementation
hdf2t = convert(h,'df2t'); % Transposed direct-form II implementation

%%
% Information about discrete-time filters can be obtained by invoking the 
% info method, for example:
info(h1)
%%
% When the Filter Design Toolbox(TM) is installed and the filter is design
% with FDESIGN, an optional string argument 'long' can be passed to
% info() to get detailed information about the filter that includes the
% design method, options, specifications, measurements and implementation
% cost.

%%
% To create a copy of an object, use the copy method, for example:
hdf1_2 = copy(hdf1);
%%
% Note that using the syntax hdf1_2 = hdf1 copies only the object handle
% and does not create a new object. 

%% Getting and Setting the Filter Coefficients
% To manipulate the coefficients of a filter as a regular MATLAB(R) vector,
% you can always get them from the object. To modify the coefficients of an
% existing DFILT object, you can set new ones.
%
% Direct-form FIR structures only have numerator coefficients; these are
% also known as the filter weights.
h1
%%
b = get(h1,'Numerator');   % Assign the coefficients to vector b
bnorm = b./max(b);         % Manipulate the vector as usual
set(h1,'Numerator',bnorm); % Set the modified coefficients

%%
% Direct-form IIR structures have numerator and denominator coefficients.
hdf1
%%
num = get(hdf1,'Numerator');  
den = get(hdf1,'Denominator');

%% Filter Analysis
% In addition to filtering, you can perform a wide range of analyses on
% DFILT objets. Most analysis functions that work with numerator and
% denominator vectors have been overloaded to work with DFILT objects.

[H,w]  = freqz(hdf2t);   % Frequency response
[Gd,w] = grpdelay(hdf1); % Group-delay
[hi,n] = impz(h2);       % Impulse response

%%
% However, the analysis functions that can produce plots are much more
% powerful when working with DFILT objects since they use the Filter
% Visualization Tool (FVTool) to plot instead of a regular MATLAB figure.

hfvt = fvtool(hdf1t);
set(hfvt, 'Color', [1 1 1])

%%
% In FVTool it is possible to set different sampling frequencies (by
% right-clicking anywhere on the axis), view magnitude, magnitude-squared,
% magnitude (dB) or zerophase responses (by right-clicking on the y-label),
% and switch between different analysis such as group delay, pole/zero
% plot, etc. (by using the toolbar or the 'Analysis' menu). Most of these
% actions can also be performed from FVTool's API (see Using FVTool's
% Application Program Interface (API) demo for more info). For example:
set(hfvt, 'MagnitudeDisplay', 'Magnitude');
%%
set(hfvt, 'Analysis', 'polezero');

%%
% Other analysis functions are available exclusively for DFILT objects.
islinphase(h1) % Checks for linear-phase
%%
isstable(hdf1) % Checks for stability
%%
order(hdf2)    % Returns filter order

%% Filtering with DFILT Objects
% The filtering operation is implemented for the structure selected. This
% is far more flexible than the usual FILTER(b,a,x) function which always
% implements transposed direct-form II.
%
% To filter, we use the overloaded FILTER function with the DFILT object as
% its first input, then the signal to be filtered as its second input. By
% default, the states of the filter, stored in the 'States' property, are
% each initialized to zero. Furthermore the 'PersistentMemory' property
% is false which means that the object is reset before the filter is run.
% This allows to filter the same sequence twice and produce the same
% output.

% To filter, we use the overloaded FILTER function with the DFILT object as
% its first input, then the signal to be filtered as its second input. 
x = ones(5,1);
y = filter(hdf1, x) 
%%
zf = hdf1.States % The object stores the final conditions in the 'States' property.


%% Multistage Filters
% It is possible to connect two or more DFILT objects in either cascade
% (serial) or parallel configurations. Because the resulting connected
% objects are DFILT objects themselves, all of the DFILT object analysis
% functions are available for the composite objects as well. Moreover,
% you can connect composite objects with other DFILT objects, resulting in
% arbitrary levels of interconnection.

Hcas = cascade(h1,hdf1);
Hpar = parallel(Hcas,hdf2);
y = filter(Hpar,randn(100,1));

%%
% For more instructive examples we turn to functions available in the 
% Filter Design Toolbox. (The following code requires that you have the 
% Filter Design Toolbox installed). Design an efficient single rate filter
% using decimators and interpolators.
f    = fdesign.lowpass('Fp,Fst,Ap,Ast',.1,.12,1,96); 
hcas = design(f,'multistage');
set(hfvt, 'Analysis', 'magnitude', 'MagnitudeDisplay', 'Magnitude (dB)', 'Filter',  hcas);

%% Frequency Transformations
% When the Filter Design Toolbox is installed, you can also perform
% frequency transformations on DFILT objects. Transformations are performed
% on a per-section basis for maximum numerical accuracy.

f = fdesign.lowpass('N,F3dB',30,.4);
hsos = design(f,'butter');       % Lowpass Butterworth with cutoff at 0.4
htrans = iirlp2hp(hsos,0.4,0.8); % Transformed filter is also SOS
set(hfvt, 'Filter', [hsos, htrans]);

%% Generating Simulink(R) Models
% When the Signal Processing Blockset(TM) is installed, you can generate Simulink(R) models of
% DFILT objects, that maintain the exact filter structure. 

realizemdl(hsos, 'Blockname', 'Filter Realization'); % Each 2nd-order section is implemented as transposed direct-form I

%%
% Single S-Function driven blocks can also be created using the BLOCK
% method. This method will use a "Digital Filter" block from the Signal
% Processing Blockset and populate its coefficient fields with the
% coefficients from the filter object.  This method only works for the
% filter structures supported by the "Digital Filter" block.
