%% Measuring Angle of Intersection
% A common task in machine vision applications is hands-free measurement 
% using image acquisition and image processing techniques.
% Your goal is to measure the angle and point of intersection between two
% beams using |bwtraceboundary|, which is a boundary tracing routine.

%% Step 1: Load Image
% Read in |gantrycrane.png| and draw arrows pointing to two beams of 
% interest. It is an image of a gantry crane used to assemble a bridge.

RGB = imread('gantrycrane.png');
imshow(RGB);

text(size(RGB,2),size(RGB,1)+15,'Image courtesy of Jeff Mather',...
     'FontSize',7,'HorizontalAlignment','right');

line([300 328],[85 103],'color',[1 1 0]);
line([268 255],[85 140],'color',[1 1 0]);

text(150,72,'Measure the angle between these beams','Color','y',...
     'FontWeight', 'bold');

%% Step 2: Extract the Region of Interest
% Crop the image to obtain only the beams of the gantry crane chosen
% earlier.  This step will make it easier to extract 
% the edges of the two metal beams.

% you can obtain the coordinates of the rectangular region using 
% pixel information displayed by imtool
start_row = 34;
start_col = 208;

cropRGB = RGB(start_row:163, start_col:400, :);

imshow(cropRGB)

% Store (X,Y) offsets for later use; subtract 1 so that each offset will
% correspond to the last pixel before the region of interest
offsetX = start_col-1;
offsetY = start_row-1;

%% Step 3: Threshold the Image
% Convert the image to black and white for subsequent extraction of the edge
% coordinates using |bwtraceboundary| routine.

I = rgb2gray(cropRGB);
threshold = graythresh(I);
BW = im2bw(I,threshold);
BW = ~BW;  % complement the image (objects of interest must be white)
imshow(BW)

%% Step 4: Find Initial Point on Each Boundary
% The |bwtraceboundary| routine requires that you specify a single
% point on a boundary. This point is used as the starting location for 
% the boundary tracing process.

%%
% To extract the edge of the lower beam, pick a column in the image and
% inspect it until a transition from a background pixel to the object
% pixel occurs.  Store this location for later use in |bwtraceboundary|
% routine. Repeat this procedure for the other beam, but this time tracing
% horizontally.

dim = size(BW);

% horizontal beam
col1 = 4;
row1 = min(find(BW(:,col1)));

% angled beam
row2 = 12;
col2 = min(find(BW(row2,:)));

%% Step 5: Trace the Boundaries
% The |bwtraceboundary| routine is used to extract (X, Y) locations of 
% the boundary points. In order to maximize the accuracy of the angle
% and point of intersection calculations, it is important to extract as many
% points belonging to the beam edges as possible. You should determine the 
% number of points experimentally. Since the initial point for the horizontal
% bar was obtained by scanning from north to south, it is safest to set the
% initial search step to point towards the outside of the object,
% i.e. 'North'.

boundary1 = bwtraceboundary(BW, [row1, col1], 'N', 8, 70);

% set the search direction to counterclockwise, in order to trace downward.
boundary2 = bwtraceboundary(BW, [row2, col2], 'E', 8, 90,'counter');

imshow(RGB); hold on;

% apply offsets in order to draw in the original image
plot(offsetX+boundary1(:,2),offsetY+boundary1(:,1),'g','LineWidth',2);
plot(offsetX+boundary2(:,2),offsetY+boundary2(:,1),'g','LineWidth',2);

%% Step 6: Fit Lines to the Boundaries
% Although (X,Y) coordinates pairs were obtained in the previous step,
% not all of the points lie exactly on a line. Which ones 
% should be used to compute the angle and point of intersection?
% Assuming that all of the acquired points are equally important,
% fit lines to the boundary pixel locations.
%
% The equation for a line is y = [x 1]*[a; b]. You can solve for parameters
% 'a' and 'b' in the least-squares sense by using |polyfit|.

ab1 = polyfit(boundary1(:,2), boundary1(:,1), 1);
ab2 = polyfit(boundary2(:,2), boundary2(:,1), 1);

%% Step 7: Find the Angle of Intersection
% Use the dot product to find the angle.

vect1 = [1 ab1(1)]; % create a vector based on the line equation
vect2 = [1 ab2(1)];
dp = dot(vect1, vect2);

% compute vector lengths
length1 = sqrt(sum(vect1.^2));
length2 = sqrt(sum(vect2.^2));

% obtain the larger angle of intersection in degrees
angle = 180-acos(dp/(length1*length2))*180/pi

%% Step 8: Find the Point of Intersection
% Solve the system of two equations in order to obtain (X,Y) coordinates
% of the intersection point.

intersection = [1 ,-ab1(1); 1, -ab2(1)] \ [ab1(2); ab2(2)];
% apply offsets in order to compute the location in the original,
% i.e. not cropped, image.
intersection = intersection + [offsetY; offsetX]

%% Step 9: Plot the Results.
%

inter_x = intersection(2);
inter_y = intersection(1);

% draw an "X" at the point of intersection
plot(inter_x,inter_y,'yx','LineWidth',2);

text(inter_x-60, inter_y-30, [sprintf('%1.3f',angle),'{\circ}'],...
     'Color','y','FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold');

interString = sprintf('(%2.1f,%2.1f)', inter_x, inter_y);

text(inter_x-10, inter_y+20, interString,...
     'Color','y','FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold');
