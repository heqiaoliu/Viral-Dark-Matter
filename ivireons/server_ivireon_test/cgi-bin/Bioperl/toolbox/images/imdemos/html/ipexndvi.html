%% Finding Vegetation in a Multispectral Image
% Variations in the reflectivity of surface materials across different
% spectral bands provide a fundamental mechanism for understanding features
% in remotely-sensed multispectral imagery.
%
% This example shows how differences between the visible red and
% near-infrared (NIR) bands of a LANDSAT image can be used to identify
% areas containing significant vegetation.  It uses a LANDSAT Thematic
% Mapper image covering part of Paris, France, made available courtesy of
% Space Imaging, LLC.  Seven spectral bands are stored in one file in the
% Erdas LAN format.

% Copyright 2004-2008 The MathWorks, Inc. 


%% Step 1: Import CIR Bands from a BIL Image File
% The LAN file, |paris.lan|, contains a 7-band 512-by-512 Landsat image. A
% 128-byte header is followed by the pixel values, which are band
% interleaved by line (BIL) in order of increasing band number.  They are
% stored as unsigned 8-bit integers, in little-endian byte order.
%
% The first step is to read bands 4, 3, and 2 from the LAN file using the
% MATLAB(R) function |multibandread|.
%
% Thematic Mapper 4, 3, and 2 bands cover the near infrared (NIR), the
% visible red, and the visible green parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
% When they are mapped to the red, green, and blue planes, respectively, of
% an RGB image the result is a standard color-infrared (CIR) composite.
% The final input argument to |multibandread| specifies which bands to
% read, and in which order, so that you can construct a composite in a
% single step.
CIR = multibandread('paris.lan', [512, 512, 7], 'uint8=>uint8',...
                    128, 'bil', 'ieee-le', {'Band','Direct',[4 3 2]});

%%
% Variable |CIR| is a 512-by-512-by-3 array of class |uint8|.  It is an RGB
% image, but with false colors.  When the image is displayed, red signifies
% the NIR band, green signifies the visible red band, and blue signifies
% the visible green band. In the CIR image, water features are very dark
% (the Seine River) and green vegetation appears red (parks and shade
% trees).  Overall, the contrast is low and the colors are subtle.

%% Step 2: Enhance the CIR Composite with a Decorrelation Stretch
% It's helpful, before analyzing the CIR composite, to enhance it for more
% effective visual display.  Because of the subtle color differences in the
% original composite, a decorrelation stretch is suitable.  You can use the
% function |decorrstretch|, which enhances color separation across
% correlated channels, and also specify an optional linear contrast stretch
% to saturate the brightest and darkest one percent of the pixels in each
% band.
decorrCIR = decorrstretch(CIR, 'Tol', 0.01);

% The surface features have become much more obvious and the image is more
% colorful. This is because the spectral differences across the scene have
% been exaggerated and the contrast has been increased.
%
% Much of the image appearance is due to the fact that healthy,
% chlorophyll-rich vegetation has a high reflectance in the near infrared.
% Because the NIR band is mapped to the red channel in our composite, any
% area with  a high vegetation density appears red in the display. A
% noticeable example is the area of bright red on the left edge, a large
% park (the Bois de Boulogne) located west of central Paris within a bend
% of the Seine River.
%
% By analyzing differences between the NIR and red bands, you can quantify
% this contrast in spectral content between vegetated areas and other
% surfaces such as pavement, bare soil, buildings, or water.

%% Step 3: Construct an NIR-Red Spectral Scatter Plot
% A scatter plot is a natural place to start when comparing the NIR band
% (displayed as red) with the visible red band (displayed as green). It's
% convenient to extract these bands from the original CIR composite into
% individual variables.  (We return to the original bands, because the
% decorrelation-stretched image is appropriate for visual display but not
% for spectral analysis.)  It's also helpful to convert from class |uint8|
% to class |single| so that the same variables can be used in the NDVI
% computation below, as well as in the scatter plot.
NIR = im2single(CIR(:,:,1));
red = im2single(CIR(:,:,2));
