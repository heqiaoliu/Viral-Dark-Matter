COM_INSTALLER_MSG_DISCOVER_DESCRIPTION="This screen allows you to discover extensions that have not gone through the normal installation process. <br />For example, some extensions are too large in file size to upload using the web interface due to limitations of the web hosting environment. Using this feature you can upload extension files directly to your web server using some other means such as FTP or SFTP and place those extension files into the appropriate directory. <br />You can then use the discover feature to find the newly uploaded extension and activate it in your Joomla! installation. <br />Using the discover operation you can also discover and install multiple extensions at the same time."
