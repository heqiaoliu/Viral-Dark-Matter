The Viral Dark Matter user interface is a web site that interfaces with a database at San Diego State University that allows users to upload experimental information straight to the database.

TODO: 
X Mutex user's ability to click vcid and bactid
X Replicate: auto increment upon data entry.  Associated only with order of entry.  (Each file gets its own replicate number)..
	• PROPOSAL for files and replicates: 
		° When a new file is uploaded, input_uploader.php checks to see if a file has already been uploaded with that EDT# via filename.  
		° Problems: If not every file has an EDT associated with it, I will start hitting biologists.  
		° Alternative: The VCID could be looked up for each file, and those without EDT's could sub in VCID.
		° Question: What needs to be in file table, just EDT, just VCID, both, and/or Replicate number?

X Add date from file to file table, show date + filename + plate/replicate when selecting VCID on view
-* Allow insertion/deletion of 
	• Files
	X bact/vcid/etc
	° plates
	° supplements
	° bases
	• etc?

X average the replicates
- recent upload section with name file date/time of experiment and upload
X change visualization of deviation from two graphs to vertical lines
X Select average/deviation from subset of viewed clones (via date)
- Single plate reader 

- mouse over shows supplement information - change source from file to db
-* Associate replicates with their plate (view)

- Table (from jeremy's excel) that shows metabolomic data, phenotype microarray, neural network prediction from "Rosetta Stone", store in table
- Tables for metabolomic data in database
- add genotype to bacteria table


5/2/12
- Progress page: view only list of bacterial external id with its VCID (link to rosetta stone, how many phenotype microarrays have been uploaded, mouse-over pop-up shows bacterium, genotype (need info)
	• PM Data table with number of reps for each plate (link to pm view page)
	• Metabolomics (link to metabolomics view)
